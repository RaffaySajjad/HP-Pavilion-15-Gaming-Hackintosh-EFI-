This EFI is provided "as is". I am not claiming it will work with your configuration, but most likely it will. You are free to try. As such I deem no responsibility for any unforeseen issues

My Laptop Configuration:
Intel i7-9750H
16GB RAM
Intel UHD 630
Nvidia GTX 1650 (Disabled)
Toshiba SSD (Not its not PM981!!!)

Please note this is not tested for laptop's equipped with PM981 SSD. You need to make necessasry changes yourself if you have that.
